## Network Layers And Protocols
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Page Is Still A Working Progress.

##### Network Protocols refer to a set of rules and conventions that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. They establish the methods and procedures for communication between different network devices.

### Physical Layer (L1)
Transmission of raw bitstreams over physical mediums.

- USB (Universal Serial Bus): 

- DSL (Digital subscriber line):

- ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)

- 802.11 WiFi (wireless fidelity):
   - 802.11
      - WiFi 1 Released: 1997 Frequency: 2.4GHz
   - 802.11b
      - WiFi 2 Released: 1999 Frequency: 2.4GHz
   - 802.11a
      - Wifi 3 Released: 1999 Frequency: 5GHz
      - Released: 2003 Frequency: 2.4GHz
   - 802.11g
      - WiFi 4 Released: 2009 Frequency: 2.4GHz, 5GHz 
   - 802.11n
      - WiFi 5 Released: 2013 Frequency: 5GHz 
   - 802.11ac
      - WiFi 6 Released: 2021 Frequency: 2.4GHz, 5GHz 
   - 802.11ax
      - WiFi 6E Released: 2024 Frequency: 6GHz 
   - 802.11be
      - WiFi 7 Released: 2024 Frequency: 2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz
   - 802.11bn
      - WiFI 8 Released: a Frequency: 2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz
 
- 1000BASE-T

### Data Link Layer (L2)
Link Layer Protocols: Protocols that work at the network interface level, facilitating data transfer between devices on the same local network, like Ethernet.

- MAC

- Ethernet

- VLan

### Network Layer (L3)
Routing data packets through the network.

- IP (Internet Protocol): Routes one packet from a source machine to a destination machine. IP wraps other higher level protocols such as TCP, UDP, etc, which handle routing packets to a specific application/port on the destination machine.

- NAT

### Transport Layer (L4)
Transport Protocols: Protocols responsible for end-to-end communication, ensuring complete data transfer. Examples include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Routes data to a specific port. TCP provides acknowledgements to verify that a packet was recieved by the destination as well as ensures ordering of packets.

- UDP (User Datagram Protocol): A lightweight protocol that routes a packet to a specific port. UDP does not handle any acknowledgement or ordering of packets.

### Session Layer (L5)
Maintaining sessions and controlling connections.

- SMB

- RTCP

- SOCKetS

### Presentation Layer (L6)
Translation of data formats and encryption.

- TLS

- SSL

### Application Layer (L7)
Application Protocols: These protocols provide services directly to end-users and define how applications interact over a network, such as HTTP for web browsing and SMTP for email.

- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Used to access web pages.

- FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring files between computers.

- DHCP

- DNS

- HTTPS

- NFS

- POP3

- SMTP

- SNMP

- NTP

- IRC

- SSH

- IMAP

## OSI Model
> [!NOTE]
> We Dont Need To Know This For GCSE AQA!

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. The OSI model is divided into seven distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities, ranging from physical hardware connections to high-level application interactions.

Each layer of the OSI model interacts with the layer directly above and below it, encapsulating and transmitting data in a structured manner. The OSI model serves as a universal language for networking, providing a common ground for different systems to communicate effectively.

### OSI vs. TCP/IP Model
The Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is older than the OSI model and was created by the US Department of Defense (DoD). A key difference between the models is that TCP/IP is simpler, collapsing several OSI layers into one:

- OSI layers 5, 6, 7 are combined into one Application Layer in TCP/IP
- OSI layers 1, 2 are combined into one Network Access Layer in TCP/IP â€“ however TCP/IP does not take responsibility for sequencing and acknowledgement functions, leaving these to the underlying transport layer.

Other important differences:
- TCP/IP is a functional model designed to solve specific communication problems, and which is based on specific, standard protocols. OSI is a generic, protocol-independent model intended to describe all forms of network communication.
- In TCP/IP, most applications use all the layers, while in OSI simple applications do not use all seven layers. Only layers 1, 2 and 3 are mandatory to enable any data communication.

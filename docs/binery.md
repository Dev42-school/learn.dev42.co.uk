## Binery And hex

#### binery to hex convertion

8 bit Binery can be split into <ins>4 bit(Nibble)</ins> chunks then converted in to hex. working from <ins>right to left</ins>

<ins>00101011</ins> would be split into <ins>0010 1011</ins> which is then converted using hex into <ins>3 B</ins> or 3RD and 11TH Hex number.

<ins>1011101</ins> would be split into <ins>101 1101</ins> as you work from right to left. the hex for that would be <ins>5 D</ins>

## Binery and Denery

#### Binery to Denery

With binery you <ins>Always work from right to left</ins> so from the right your first Binery number represents <ins>1</ins> then doubles every next value. A 4 bit number would represent 8 4 2 1 so 1010 would be 8 + 2 = 10 or 1100 would be 8 + 4 = 12

## Hex and Denery

#### Hex to Denery

best way to do this is to go from Hex to Binery then fromm Binery to Denery

## Binery Shift

this is used for <ins>doubling or halfing</ins> the value. Use a binery left shift to <ins>double</ins> the number or a binery right shift to <ins>half it</ins>.
